# social-network-friend-suggestion

Friend Suggestion System â€“ C++ (Graph, BFS, BST)  
- Developed a friend recommendation system using Graph (Adjacency List) to store user connections and BFS for second-degree friend discovery.  
- Implemented a Binary Search Tree (BST) to efficiently sort and rank friend suggestions based on the number of mutual connections.  
- Optimized the system for O(V + E) traversal using BFS and O(log N) insertions in BST, ensuring scalability for large networks.  
- Demonstrated expertise in data structures, algorithm optimization, and real-world graph applications.
